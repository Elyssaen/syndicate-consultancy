Today there's an unusual number of patrons, but the place is no less dreary for it. A newsfeed periodically overwhelms the background noise with updates on a recent flare-up in pirate activity in the region: all non-essential travel is grounded. Thankfully, these advisory messages don't apply to an independent merchant captain like yourself.`

He barely made it through Sheratan alive, and evidently doesn't think much of Syndicate Security. Apparently, a lone Quicksilver travelling the same route didn't even join the Syndicate forces in their resistance... just ran straight through at full speed.`
